This is currently under development. Not ready to use.

### Todo

 * cleanup POSIX namespace violation (defined types ending with `_t`)
 * what should happen if a client ends up with no tag set ?
 * implement restack function and border coloring
 * fill in EWMH info
 * make pixel perfect tiles
 * experiment with [RandR][randr] - automatic handling of

   - mirrored outputs
   - overlapping outputs
   - rotated outputs
